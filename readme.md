A Customized
[Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) Browser Extension,
having [contextual mapping](https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c/wiki/Map-a-key-to-different-commands-on-different-websites),
  [global shortcuts](https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c/wiki/Trigger-commands-in-an-input-box#user-content-shortcut),
  [command sequences](https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c/wiki/Auto-run-a-tree-of-commands) and [injection](https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c/wiki/Inject-into-other-extensions) functionality,
  in C-style code for quicker action and less resource cost.

This project is mainly developed and maintained by [gdh1995](https://github.com/gdh1995) (Gong Dahan),
and open-sourced under the [Apache-2.0 license](LICENSE.txt).

It (the released version) supports the new Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers
  whose core versions are >= 102, and has a perfect support for a recent Firefox (since version 101.0, desktop).
It can even run on Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML), though there're still some errors.
If re-compiled from the source code, Vimium C is able to support Chromium 32~108 and Firefox 63~100.

# Keyboard Bindings
_This section is modified from [philc/vimium 's](https://github.com/philc/vimium#keyboard-bindings)._

Modifier keys are specified as `<c-x>`, `<m-x>`, and `<a-x>` for Ctrl+x, Meta+x, and Alt+x respectively.
For Shift+X and Ctrl+Shift+X, just type `X` and `<c-s-x>`.
See the next section for how to customize these bindings.

Once you have Vimium C installed, you can see this list of key bindings at any time by typing `?`.

Navigating the current page:

    ?       show the help dialog for a list of all available keys
    h       scroll left
    j       scroll down
    k       scroll up
    l       scroll right
    gg      scroll to top of the page
    G       scroll to bottom of the page
    d       scroll down half a page
    u       scroll up half a page
    f       show hints for links and buttons to open in the current tab
    F       show link hints and open a link in a new tab
    r       reload
    gs      view source
    i       enter insert mode -- all commands will be ignored until you hit Esc to exit
    yy      copy the current url to the clipboard
    yf      copy a link url to the clipboard
    gf      cycle forward to the next frame
    gF      focus the main/top frame

Navigating to new pages:

    o       open URL, bookmark, or history entry, on an English letter "o"
    O       open URL, bookmark, history entry in a new tab, on an English letter "O"
    b       open bookmark
    B       open bookmark in a new tab

Using find:

    /       enter find mode
              -- type your search query and hit enter to search, or Esc to cancel
    n       cycle forward to the next find match
    N       cycle backward to the previous find match

For advanced usage, see [regular expressions](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Find-Mode) on the wiki.

Navigating your history:

    H       go back in history
    L       go forward in history

Manipulating tabs:

    J, gT   go one tab left
    K, gt   go one tab right
    g0      go to the first tab. Use `ng0` to go to n-th tab, on `g` and a number character of `0`
    g$      go to the last tab
    ^       visit the previously-visited tab
    t       create tab
    yt      duplicate current tab
    x       close current tab
    X       restore closed tab (i.e. unwind the `x` command)
    T       search through your open tabs
    W       move current tab to new window
    <a-p>   pin/unpin current tab

Using marks:

    ma, mA  set local mark "a" (global mark "A")
    `a, `A  jump to local mark "a" (global mark "A")
    ``      jump back to the position before the previous jump
              -- that is, before the previous gg, G, n, N, / or `a

Additional advanced browsing commands:

    ]], [[  follow the link labeled "next or ">" ("previous" or "<">)
              - helpful for browsing paginated sites
    <a-f>   open multiple links in a new tab
    gi      focus the first (or n-th) text input box on the page. Use <tab> to cycle through options.
    gu      go up one level in the URL hierarchy
    gU      go up to root of the URL hierarchy
    ge      edit the current URL
    gE      edit the current URL and open in a new tab
    zH      scroll all the way left
    zL      scroll all the way right
    v       enter visual mode; use p/P to paste-and-go, use y to yank, use v/c/V to toggle visual/line/caret modes
    V       enter visual line mode
    yc      select a first word of a sentence and enter visual mode

Vimium C supports command repetition so, for example, hitting `5t` will open 5 tabs in rapid succession. `<esc>`
(or `<c-[>`) will clear any partial commands in the queue and will also exit insert and find modes.

There are some advanced commands which aren't documented here; refer to the help dialog (type `?`) for a full list.


# Custom Key Mappings
_This section is modified from [philc/vimium 's](https://github.com/philc/vimium#custom-key-mappings)._

When you have just installed Vimium C, it will open a new tab to show its default key mappings,
and you may also open Vimium C's options page and press `?` (usually it's `Shift+/`) to show those mappings again.

You may remap or unmap any of the default key bindings in the "Custom key mappings" on the options page.

Enter one of the following key mapping commands per line:

* `map <key> command`: Maps a _key_ to a Vimium C command. Overrides web pages' default behavior (if any).
* `mapKey <key> <another_key>`: Let Vimium C treat _key_ as _another key_. Can not affect your browser or web pages.
* `unmap <key>`: Unmaps a key and restores the default behavior (if any).
* `unmapAll`: Unmaps all bindings. This is useful if you want to completely wipe Vimium C's default commands and start
  from scratch with your own setup.

Examples:

* `map r reload` maps the r key to reloading the page.
* `map <c-d> scrollPageDown` maps Ctrl+D to scrolling the page down.
* `unmap r` removes any mapping for the r key.
* `unmap <c-d>` removes any mapping for Ctrl+D and restores web page or browser's default behavior.
* `unmap g0` removes any mapping for a `g` key and a next `0` key.

Available Vimium C commands can be found via the "Show available commands" link or `?` key on the options page.
The command name appears to the right of the description in parenthesis.

You can add comments to key mappings by starting a line with `"` or `#`, or a space character and a next `#` in a line.

The following special keys are available for mapping:

* `<c-*>`, `<a-*>`, `<s-*>`, `<m-*>` for Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and Meta (Command on macOS) respectively with any key.
  Replace `*` with the key name of choice.
* `<left>`, `<right>`, `<up>`, `<down>` for the arrow keys.
* `<f1>` through `<f12>` for the function keys.
* `<space>` for the space key.
* `<tab>`, `<enter>`, `<delete>`, `<backspace>`, `<insert>`, `<home>` and `<end>` for non-printable keys

Here're some advanced usages which are different with philc/vimium:

* <kbd>Shift</kbd> are automatically detected, so, `&` corresponds to <kbd>Shift+7</kbd> on an English QWERTY keyboard.
  * However, if a single key is longer than 1 character, please wrap it with `<`+`>` and insert a `s-`
  * If you want to trigger a key when multiple modifier keys are pressed, sort `a/c/m/s-` prefixes by letter order
  * For example, these keys are valid names: `<s-left>`, `<c-j>`, `<a-s-k>`, `<a-#>` and `<a-?>`
* `mapKey <key:o> <another_key>` makes _key_ work as another key only in a special mode named Vomnibar
  * `mapKey` rules always take effect before matching a key with `map` rules
  * some other modes are list in https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c/wiki/Use-in-another-keyboard-layout#per-mode-mapkey
* `map <key:i> command` makes _key_ trigger the command in insert mode only, but not the default normal mode
* since v1.99.98, `map! <single_key>` maps _key_ in both normal mode and insert mode, if only it's not a long sequence
  * For example, `map! jj` is invalid, but `map! <home>` and `map! <c-j>` are suitable
* `unmap` can only unmap a manually-mapped key or a default key, so a second `unmap <key>` may result in an error
  * You may use `unmap!` when you're not sure whether a key has been mapped before
* number keys (`0`-`9` and `-`) are mapped to "count prefix" of commands by default, so won't be passed to web pages.
  * And then, even after `unmapAll`, they will be automatically added back on a next `map`
  * you may write `unmap 0` to unmap it explicitly
